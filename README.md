# Query Extractor VS Code Extension

A simple VS Code extension to **extract variables** from SQL queries and copy them to your clipboard.

## ‚ú® Features

- Extracts variables of the form `${variableName}` from SQL queries.
- Ignores comments (`--` and `/* */`) by default.
- Works for both:
  - Whole `.sql` files
  - Selected text inside any file
- Automatically copies the found variables as a comma-separated list to your clipboard.
- Shows a notification with the count of variables copied.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open a `.sql` file or select a SQL query snippet.
2. Run the command **`Query Extractor: Extract Variables`**:
   - Open **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
   - Search for **"Query Extractor: Extract Variables"**.
3. If variables are found:
   - They are copied to your clipboard.
   - You‚Äôll see a message like `Copied 3 variables to clipboard`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- Variables are matched using the regex:

  ```regex
  (?<!\\)(?:['"])?\$\{\s*([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_\.]*)\s*\}(?:['"])?
  ```

- This ensures escaped variables (`\${var}`) are ignored.

- Comments are stripped before parsing.
